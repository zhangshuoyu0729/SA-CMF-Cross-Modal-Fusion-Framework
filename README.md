# SA-CMF-Cross-Modal-Fusion-Framework
We propose a Secondary Attention-Based Cross-Modal Fusion (SA-CMF) framework, which exploits modality-specific attention to preserve unique feature characteristics, employs cross-attention to model inter-modal dependencies, and incorporates mutual information–based adjustment to suppress redundancy and mitigate distribution discrepancies.
